            <h2>General Information</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Non-silicate minerals are a diverse group of minerals that do not primarily contain silicon (Si) and oxygen (O) as their core components. Instead, they are made up of various other elements such as carbon (C), sulfur (S), halogens (Cl, F, Br, I), and metals like iron (Fe), copper (Cu), and lead (Pb). These minerals form a variety of structures and chemical compositions that are different from silicates. While non-silicate minerals are less abundant than silicates, they are still very important and widespread in the Earth's crust.</p>

        <h2>Formation of Non-Silicate Minerals</h2>
        <p>Non-silicate minerals form through different geological processes, often involving chemical reactions or the evaporation of water. Key processes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Evaporite formation:</strong> Minerals like halite and gypsum form when water evaporates in arid environments, leaving behind concentrated salts.</li>
            <li><strong>Metamorphism:</strong> Some non-silicate minerals, such as calcite or magnetite, form during metamorphism, where high temperature and pressure alter pre-existing rocks.</li>
            <li><strong>Oxidation and precipitation:</strong> Many oxide and sulfide minerals, such as hematite and pyrite, form through oxidation or precipitation from aqueous solutions, commonly in sedimentary environments or from hydrothermal fluids.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Setting and Conditions for Formation</h2>
        <p>The conditions for non-silicate mineral formation vary widely:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Non-silicates like oxides (e.g., hematite) can form at a range of temperatures, from low to high, depending on the mineral.</li>
            <li><strong>Evaporation:</strong> Minerals such as halite and gypsum form under conditions of high evaporation, typically in arid or semi-arid regions.</li>
            <li><strong>Chemical environment:</strong> The availability of specific elements in the surrounding environment, like sulfur for sulfides (e.g., pyrite) or carbon for carbonates (e.g., calcite), influences the types of non-silicate minerals that form.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Non-silicate minerals, though less abundant than silicate minerals, play essential roles in various industries and are important in geological processes. They are formed under a wide range of conditions, from evaporating seas to high-pressure metamorphic environments, and serve critical functions in construction, manufacturing, and resource extraction.</p>
