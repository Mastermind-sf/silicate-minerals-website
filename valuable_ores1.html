        <h1 class="title">Most Valuable Non-Silicate Ores</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Non-silicate minerals, while not as abundant as silicate ores, are extremely valuable due to their economic importance in metal extraction, industrial applications, and use as gemstones. Below are some of the most valuable non-silicate ores:</p>

            <h2>1. Hematite (Fe₂O₃)</h2>
            <p><strong>Use:</strong> Hematite is a primary ore of iron and is the most important source of iron for steel production. It is also used as a pigment due to its reddish-brown color and in various polishing and abrasive applications.</p>
            <p><strong>Mining Locations:</strong> Major deposits of hematite are found in Brazil, Australia, China, India, and Russia.</p>

            <h2>2. Magnetite (Fe₃O₄)</h2>
            <p><strong>Use:</strong> Magnetite is another significant iron ore, often used in the production of steel. Its magnetic properties are utilized in industrial processes and in magnetic separation. It is also used as a source of iron in heavy media separation in coal washing.</p>
            <p><strong>Mining Locations:</strong> Significant magnetite deposits are found in Australia, the United States, China, and Sweden.</p>

            <h2>3. Pyrite (FeS₂)</h2>
            <p><strong>Use:</strong> Often called "fool's gold," pyrite is mined as a source of sulfur for industrial use. It is also used in the production of sulfuric acid, an essential chemical in various industries. Additionally, pyrite can sometimes contain trace amounts of gold, making it valuable for gold extraction.</p>
            <p><strong>Mining Locations:</strong> Pyrite is found in significant quantities in Spain, Peru, China, and South Africa.</p>

            <h2>4. Galena (PbS)</h2>
            <p><strong>Use:</strong> Galena is the primary ore of lead, which is used in batteries (especially lead-acid batteries), radiation shielding, and in various industrial applications. It is also used as a source of silver, as galena often contains trace amounts of silver.</p>
            <p><strong>Mining Locations:</strong> Major galena deposits are found in the United States, Australia, Mexico, and Peru.</p>

            <h2>5. Barite (BaSO₄)</h2>
            <p><strong>Use:</strong> Barite is primarily used in drilling fluids for the oil and gas industry due to its high density. It is also used as a filler in paint, rubber, and plastics, and in the production of barium chemicals.</p>
            <p><strong>Mining Locations:</strong> Significant barite deposits are found in China, India, Morocco, and the United States.</p>

            <h2>6. Fluorite (CaF₂)</h2>
            <p><strong>Use:</strong> Fluorite is an important source of fluorine, which is used in the manufacture of chemicals such as hydrofluoric acid, and in the production of aluminum, uranium, and Teflon. Fluorite is also used as a flux in steel production and in the manufacture of optical lenses and instruments.</p>
            <p><strong>Mining Locations:</strong> Major fluorite producers include China, Mexico, Mongolia, and South Africa.</p>

            <h2>7. Apatite (Ca₅(PO₄)₃(F,Cl,OH))</h2>
            <p><strong>Use:</strong> Apatite is the primary source of phosphate, which is used in the production of fertilizers. Phosphate is essential for agriculture and is also used in animal feed and industrial chemicals.</p>
            <p><strong>Mining Locations:</strong> Major apatite deposits are found in Morocco, China, the United States, and Russia.</p>
